If you want your research to be freely available to everyone, then you should choose a journal that offers Open Access, but remember, if you select this method, you or your funders will be responsible for paying an [article processing charge](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/journals-books/journal-pricing-faqs). Be aware that many funders will insist on open access.

**KEY FACT: Article Processing charges can vary from around 700 EURÂ  to almost 10,000 EURO depending on the publication. A [full list](https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000227571-find-the-apc-for-a-specific-journal) of charges is available.**
